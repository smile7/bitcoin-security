						<ul>
							<li>51% attack</li>
							<p>The so called ‘51% Attack’ is considered to be the most dangerous weakness of the bitcoin network. It becomes possible when a person or a group get to own more than 50% of the computing power in the network. This advantage of the individual or the group can be used to fork the main transaction blockchain. This way there are a lot of possibilities to commit fraud, such as double spending.</p>
							<p>The bitcoin network could once fall in this case when a mining pool - a group of individuals who share computational power, called Ghash.io almost approached the 50% limit. The miners had no intentions to do any harm and that is why they left the pool and joined smaller ones. Ghash.io also stopped accepting new miners.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, we can see that the situation was resolved thanks to the good will and intentions of the pool owners and the miners. These days the mining power becomes more and more distributed which lowers the possibility of such case to happen again, but still theoretically it is achievable, moreover it almost happened once.</p>
							<li>"Pony" Botnet</li>
							<p>For over 5 months starting from September 2013 a botnet called Pony was used to infect a huge amount of computers. It was the same botnet which was used to steal over 2 million passwords. The amount of the stolen bitcoins was $220,000 and this is a clear example of the vulnerability of storing bitcoins on devices connected to the internet.</p>
							<p>It is  clear that there are several security issues with bitcoin, but most of them are not connected to the bitcoin protocol at all, but to the everyone’s actions. For example, storing the bitcoins in an offline wallet could eliminate the ‘Pony’ botnet threat.</p>
