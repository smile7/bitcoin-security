						<ul>
							<li>What is blockchain?</li>
							<p>The easiest way this could be explained is with the Google Docs analogy. Imagine a spreadsheet that does not need to be resend between parties but can be modified simultaneously by many people. The same is the idea of the blockchain. All data in the blockchain is a shared database that is continually updated. Bitcoin is built over blockchain and nowadays is widely used. Users can transact to each other. In 2016 Bitcoin transactions costed over $200 000 a day.</p>
							<li>Robustness</li>
							<p><strong>Blockchain cannot be controlled by any single entity!<br />Blockchain has no single point of failure!<br /></strong>Bitcoin was invented in 2008 and since that, the Bitcoin blockchain has operated without singnificant disruption, related to the blockchain. However there WERE problems due to hacking.</p>
							<li>Transparency</li>
							<p>The blockchain network automatically updates every ten minutes. Hence every transaction in the 10-minute interval is reconciled. Each group of these transactions is called a “block”. From this, two important properties result:<strong> Transparency - all data is public.<br/>No corruption - altering units of information on the blockchain would mean that a huge amount of computing power is being used.</strong></p>
							<li>How it is created?</li>
							<p>The blockchain is made of nodes. A node is a computer, connected to the blockchain network using a client that performs transactions. The nodes create a network that is decentralised. Every node is an administrator of the blockchain and joins the network voluntarily. Computers join this network in order to be able to win bitcoins. This process is called “mining”, but this term is misleading as because in reality each one of the computers, connected to the network, is solving computational puzzles and thus trying to win a Bitcoin. These coins were also the reason why this blockchain technology was created but it could be used for many potential applications.</p>
							<li>Security</li>
							<p>Because of the decentralised system, blockchain is significantly more secure than the Internet. Its network does not have centralised entities of vulnerability that hackers can attack. In the Internet we rely on the “username/password” to protect our identity. But the blockchain security uses encryption. It uses keys - public and private. The public key is a long generated number and it is the user’s address on the blockchain. Bitcoins sent across the network gets recorded as belonging to that address. The private key is like a password that gives to its owner access to his digital assets.</p>
