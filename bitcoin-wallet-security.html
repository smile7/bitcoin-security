							<h2>Bitcoin Wallet Security</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
                            <p>A Bitcoin wallet is like a wallet with cash. If you wouldn't keep a thousand dollars in your pocket, you might want to have the same consideration for your Bitcoin wallet. In general, it is a good practice to keep only small amounts of bitcoins on your computer, mobile, or server for everyday uses and to keep the remaining part of your funds in a safer environment.</p>
							<li>Wallet Backup</li>
							<p>Stored in a safe place, a backup of the wallet protects against computer failures and many human mistakes. The wallet can also be recovered after a mobile or a computer was stolen.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Backup the entire wallet</li>
                                <p>Some wallets use many hidden private keys internally. If you only have a backup of the private keys for your visible Bitcoin addresses, you might not be able to recover a great part of your funds with your backup.</p>
                                <li>Encrypt online backups</li>
                                <p>Any backup that is stored online is highly vulnerable to theft. Even a computer that is connected to the Internet is vulnerable to malicious software. As such, encrypting any backup that is exposed to the network is a good security practice.</p>
                                <li>Use many secure locations</li>
                                <p>Single points of failure are bad for security. If your backup is not dependent of a single location, it is less likely that any bad event will prevent you to recover your wallet. You might also want to consider using different medias like USB keys, papers and CDs.</p>
                                <li>Make regular backups</li>
                                <p></p>
                            </ol>
							<li>Offline</li>
							<p>An offline wallet, also known as cold storage, provides the highest level of security for savings. It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network. When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities. Using an offline wallet in conjunction with backups and encryption is also a good practice.</p>
                            <li>Keep updated software</li>
                            <p>Using the latest version of your Bitcoin software allows you to receive important stability and security fixes. Updates can prevent problems of various severity, include new useful features and help keep your wallet safe. Installing updates for all other software on your computer or mobile is also important to keep your wallet environment safer.</p>
                            <li>Multi signature</li>
                            <p>Bitcoin includes a multi-signature feature that allows a transaction to require multiple independent approvals to be spent. This can be used by an organization to give its members access to its treasury while only allowing a withdrawal if 3 of 5 members sign the transaction. Some web wallets also provide multi-signature wallets, allowing the user to keep control over their money while preventing a thief from stealing funds by compromising a single device or server.</p>
