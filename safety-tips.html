							<h2>Safety Tips</h2>
						</header>
                        <p>Unfortunately, vulnerabilities exist and there are ways bitcoins can be stolen, but if people take appropriate measures their coins will always be secured. Everybody has to familiarize themselves with what they should do to avoid putting their wallet at risk. Here are some of the ways that hackers often use to steal cryptocurrency and measures to prevent them:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Someone hacks your account</li>
							<p>If you use a third-party service, you don’t have to remember your public and private key. Instead, you only remember your username and password, as in every other website. But this makes it possible for thieves to rob you by obtaining your password. The most common way they do this is by breaking into customers’ email accounts, and then asking the service you’re using to reset their password. The password reset request is then sent to the compromised email account, allowing the thief access to the bitcoin funds.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to prevent this?</strong></p>
                            <p>Secure your email account and bitcoin storage service you use with 2-factor authentication - for example login that consists not only with password authentication, but SMS also. You may also use Google Authenticator.</p>
							<li>Exposing the private key</li>
                            <p>This case can happen only if you're managing your own wallet rather than using a third-party service. In one quite instructive example, someone showed their private key in a TV show. Yes, his wallet was emptied.</p>
							<p><strong>How to prevent it?</strong></p>
                            <p>You should keep your private key on a safe place written down on paper and hidden. Do not store it online.</p>
							<li>ICO</li>
                            <p>Recently new way of stealing occurred when companies held initial coin offerings. They asked investors to send them bitcoins and then impersonated the companies with a fake website and persuaded the investors to send millions of dollars worth of funds to a different bitcoin wallet. Once the bitcoin was sent, there was no recovering it, and both the companies and investors lost their bitcoin.</p>
							<p><strong>How to prevent it?</strong></p>
                            <p>When you go to transfer bitcoin funds to someone, confirm the wallet address is genuine.</p>
